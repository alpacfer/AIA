    "### Step-by-Step Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probabilities Introduction:** Each \\(p_{408}(x)\\) can be seen as the fraction of features in cluster 408 that belong to label \\(x\\). Probabilities range from 0 to 1, where 0 means no features of that label exist in the cluster, and 1 means all features belong to that label.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Given Information:** We know that 483 out of 653 features in cluster 408 are of label 2. This means \\(p_{408}(2) = \\frac{483}{653}\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculation of Remaining Probabilities:** Since there are only three labels, and the probabilities must sum up to 1 (as every feature must be classified under one of the labels), we can use the given information to calculate the sum of probabilities for the remaining labels, \\(p_{408}(1)\\) and \\(p_{408}(3)\\), by subtracting \\(p_{408}(2)\\) from 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Formula Application:** \n",
    "   - To find \\(p_{408}(1) + p_{408}(3)\\), we calculate \\(1 - p_{408}(2)\\).\n",
    "   - \\(p_{408}(2)\\) is found by dividing the number of features with label 2 by the total number of features in cluster 408, as already stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Subtraction to Find the Sum:** After calculating \\(p_{408}(2)\\), we subtract this value from 1 to find the sum of \\(p_{408}(1) + p_{408}(3)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach simplifies understanding the distribution of labels within the cluster and how it affects the overall segmentation model. By focusing on the calculation of the combined probability of the remaining labels, you gain insight into how features within a cluster are distributed across the available labels, excluding the one already specified (label 2 in this case). This calculation and the resulting probability are crucial for understanding the model's behavior and how it interprets the data within that specific cluster."
